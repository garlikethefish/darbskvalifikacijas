        <UpdatePost>0.6 ≽^•⩊•^≼ update<template #content>At last, the serum is complete! A volatile cocktail of quantum-infused plasma, gamma-irradiated spores, and just a pinch of plutonium—enough to make lesser men tremble, but I, Dr. Radium, laugh in the face of the laws of nature!</template></UpdatePost>
        <UpdatePost>(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ 0.5 update<template #content>Subject: One (1) albino rat, designation: Reginald. Injection administered. Initial reaction: mild twitching… escalating to violent convulsions… Yes! YES! A breakthrough! But wait—Reginald has stopped moving. No, no, no! Did I miscalculate the photon resonance? Have I once again flown too close to the sun?</template></UpdatePost>
        <UpdatePost>0.4 update ╭∩╮( •̀_•́ )╭∩╮<template #content>Reginald LIVES! But… something is different. His eyes glow with an unearthly green light, and—sweet Tesla—he is standing upright! Could it be? Have I… accelerated evolution itself?</template></UpdatePost>
        <UpdatePost>⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂)⸝♡ 0.3 update<template #content>Reginald now exhibits heightened intelligence. He refuses the maze, preferring instead to observe me. I swear he smirked.</template></UpdatePost>
        <UpdatePost>(¬_¬") 0.2 (¬_¬") update<template #content>The fools at the Institute laughed at me. They mocked my theories, dismissed my brilliance! But tonight, their ignorance will crumble beneath the weight of my genius. For I, Dr. Victor Radium, have done the impossible. I have unlocked the Key to Life Itself! My latest serum, a blend of hypercharged amino acids, bio-electric catalysts, and just a sprinkle of cosmic radiation, is ready for testing. If my calculations are correct (and they always are), this will redefine evolution itself!”</template></UpdatePost>
